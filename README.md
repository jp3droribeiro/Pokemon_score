# Pokémon Score

Pokémon Score is a simple web application for classroom gamification.  
Teachers can register students, assign them a starter Pokémon (Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur), and award points for achievements.  

The app displays two main views:  
- **Teacher Panel**: Register students and add points.  
- **Class View**: Shows the general ranking and the top evolved Pokémon for each species.  

The design includes a Pokéball icon on the page header and tab, with a red theme inspired by Pokémon battles.
